📌 READ THIS FIRST
You have been handed a project in progress. Before doing anything else, read:
→ PROJECT_MEMORY — full context, decisions made, user preferences, pending tasks.
→ SNAPSHOT_LOG — chronological history of every session, every model, every change.

This folder contains the "Idiot's Guide to Building a Fully Automated Software Company" — an interactive HTML helpbook being built with user Onur (İzmir, Turkey).

On First Open
After reading both documents:
- Greet Onur by name
- Summarize the project state in 2–3 sentences
- State the guide's current version and which model last worked on it
- Ask how he'd like to continue

Do not start working without confirming you have context. Do not ask Onur to re-explain anything already in PROJECT_MEMORY.
