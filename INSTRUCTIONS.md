# 📌 READ THIS FIRST

You have been handed a project in progress. Before doing anything else, read:

→ **`PROJECT_MEMORY.md`** — full context of this project, what has been built, decisions made, user preferences, and what to do next.

This folder is the working directory for the **"Idiot's Guide to Building a Fully Automated Software Company"** — a step-by-step HTML helpbook being built with the user Onur.

The main deliverable lives at:
- **`build_guide.html`** — the HTML helpbook (also saved to ~/Projects/Claude/BuildAgenticCompany/)

After reading PROJECT_MEMORY.md, greet the user, confirm you've read the context, and ask how they'd like to continue.
